So far, these are the functions available: 
1. Basic arithematic operations (+, -, *, and /). These operations comply to the BODMAS rule
2. Signing and unsigning numbers with the ± button
3. The "C" button can be used to clear the display or the "del" button can be used to delete one digit at a time from right to left
4. The "." for creating decimals
